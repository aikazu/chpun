# Completed Task Log

| ID | Description | Completion Notes |
| -- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| T001 | Initial analysis and refactoring of `script.js` and `style.css` for particle optimization. | Moved particle container to `index.html`, updated `script.js` to use the new container, and added CSS for particle container. |
| T001 | Refactored local storage management in `script.js`. | Centralized local storage operations into `loadGameData` and `saveGameData` functions. |
| T001 | Refactored CSS for modal consistency. | Removed redundant `.settings-container` styles and applied them to `.modal-content` for both modals. |
| T001 | Completed codebase analysis, improvement, and optimization. | All planned refactorings and optimizations have been applied. |
| T005 | Removed duplicate HTML elements. | Removed duplicate `achievements-button` and `power-up-container` elements from `index.html`. |
| T005 | Added `z-index` to floating numbers. | Added `z-index` to `.floating-number` in `style.css` to ensure visibility. |
| T005 | Refactored `Modal` class. | Moved `Modal` class to `modal.js` and updated `script.js` and `index.html` accordingly. |
| T005 | Optimized GSAP animations. | Used `gsap.fromTo()` for `createParticles` and `showFloatingNumber` functions in `script.js`. |
| T005 | Refactored upgrade logic. | Extracted upgrade logic into separate functions in `script.js` for better readability and maintainability. |
| T005 | Improved accessibility. | Added `aria-label` attributes to buttons in `index.html`. |
| T005 | Fixed module import and combo bar animation. | Changed `script.js` to a module in `index.html` and adjusted combo bar animations and duration in `script.js`. |
| T006 | Fixed combo duration inconsistency. | Updated default combo duration from 1000ms to 3000ms in both initialization and prestige reset. |
| T006 | Fixed prestige reset issues. | Removed redundant loadGameData() call and added proper UI updates after prestige. |
| T006 | Added audio error handling. | Wrapped audio play calls in try-catch blocks to prevent errors when audio fails. |
| T006 | Enhanced power-up system. | Added z-index, proper cleanup, and save operations for power-ups. |
| T006 | Improved auto-puncher functionality. | Added achievement checks and save operations to auto-puncher interval. |
| T006 | Updated documentation. | Enhanced README.md with comprehensive feature list and updated TECH-STACK.md with all dependencies. |
