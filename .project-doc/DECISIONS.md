## Decision D001: Initial Technology Stack Selection

*   **Context:** The project requires a simple, fast, and scalable technology stack to support a web-based incremental game with a real-time global leaderboard.
*   **Options Considered:**
    1.  **HTML/CSS/JS with Firebase:**
        *   **Pros:** Rapid development, easy to learn, massive community support, Firebase provides a simple and effective backend for the leaderboard.
        *   **Cons:** May not be as performant as a dedicated game engine for complex animations.
    2.  **Game Engine (e.g., Phaser):**
        *   **Pros:** Optimized for game development, better performance for complex animations and effects.
        *   **Cons:** Steeper learning curve, more complex setup, may be overkill for a simple clicker game.
*   **Decision:** The team has decided to use **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for the frontend, and **Firebase Firestore** for the backend leaderboard.
*   **Consequences:** This decision prioritizes rapid development and a simple, accessible technology stack. If performance becomes an issue, we may need to refactor the rendering logic or consider a more advanced rendering library.
